First pancake
Just casually doing the tutorial and feeling like I need to study more. I'm stidying android programming, but so far I only watched one webinar about it, installed Android Studio and finished a few exercises. In the future I want to make the useful mobile apps and my ultimate goal is to create a nice anti-stress game for people with anxiety.
